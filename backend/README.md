## Write Like a Human Backend
Here are the key parameters to consider for feedback table:

Structural Comparison
• Sentence Length & Complexity – Average sentence length and syntactic structures (simple, compound, complex).
• Paragraph Structure – Organization, transitions, and logical flow.
• Use of Headings & Formatting – If applicable, consistency in sectioning.

Vocabulary & Word Choice
• Lexical Diversity – Measure of unique words used (Type-Token Ratio or MTLD).
• Word Frequency & Repetition – Common words used repeatedly across drafts.
• Academic vs. Informal Language – Shift in tone, complexity, or sophistication.

Writing Style & Voice
• Readability Score – Comparison of readability metrics (Flesch-Kincaid, SMOG, etc.).
• Passive vs. Active Voice – Changes in sentence construction.
• Use of First vs. Third Person – Consistency in narrative perspective.
• Use of Dialogue & Descriptive Language – Change in storytelling techniques.

Grammar & Mechanics
• Punctuation Usage – Frequency and type of punctuation used.
• Grammar Patterns – Common errors or stylistic tendencies (e.g., run-ons, fragments).
• Spelling Variations – Misspelled words or consistent stylistic spelling choices.

Topic Consistency & Thematic Elements
• Key Themes & Subject Matter – Recurrent topics or shifts in focus.
• Keyword Frequency – How often key terms appear across pieces.
• Argument Development – How ideas are built upon or refined.

Sentence & Phrase Similarity
• N-gram Analysis – Repeated word sequences that indicate stylistic consistency.
• TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) – Shows words that are uniquely weighted in each text.
• Jaccard Similarity – Measures overlap of words or phrases between texts.

AI vs. Human Writing Detection
• Changes in Originality – If previous work was mostly human-generated, shifts toward AI-like text should be flagged.
• Predictability Score – Checks for formulaic or unnatural structuring.

Overall Text Length & Word Count
• Total Word Count – Growth or reduction in writing length.
• Sentence Count – Number of sentences compared across pieces.
